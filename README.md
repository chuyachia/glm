This repository contains markdown files generated by R that are my notes when learning Generalized Linear Models. In these notes, instead of using readily available linear model packages in R, I fit the data and calculated the relevant statistical tests by myself to have a better understanding.

* normallinear: pseudo inverse, Wald test, F test, residuals
* binary: scoring, logit, probit, complementary log-log, deviance, latent variable interpretation
* count: poisson, quasi-poisson, negative binomial
